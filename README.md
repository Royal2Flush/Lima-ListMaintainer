# Lima ListMaintainer

Lima is a lightweight maintainer for file lists for Windows.

The idea originated from managing my phone's music library. On my PC I have whole albums in my library that I can manage through playlists. On my phone the memory of the SD card was a limiting factor to this approach. Therefor I used to copy single files from my PC to the SD card. However, since I did not maintain a folder structure it became very confusing very quickly.

Lima solves this problem by keeping a list of files and copying them to a specific location. Files removed from the list will automatically be deleted in the target destination. Therefore it's easily possible to keep the same library of files on different target devices. Of course the application is not limited to music.

I consider this project finished. However, if you have additional feature proposals, we can discuss them.
